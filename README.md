- 👋 Hi, I’m @rduran2020
- 👀 I’m interested in programming a Raspberry 4 with various sparkfun I2C bus devices. relays, ADC devices, current and temperature devices to monitor and control a battery backup system for a Solar array.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning How to talk on the I2C bus usint the I2C tools.  this has allowed me to know they talk to the devices and get their addresses. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to get a working library of commands to use in speaking to the devices for use in a monitoring program
- 📫 How to reach me by phone, 4809387401
